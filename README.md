This project is made up of two practical, user friendly Python tools designed to demonstrate key financial concepts in mortgage planning and currency conversion.

Part 1 – Mortgage Calculator

This tool helps users calculate mortgage payments based on the following inputs:
- Principal amount
- Annual interest rate
- Amortization period (in years)

It then calculates and displays the mortgage payments across different payment frequencies:
- Monthly
- Semi-monthly
- Bi-weekly
- Weekly
- Rapid Bi-weekly
- Rapid Weekly

By comparing these options, users can better understand how payment schedules impact their long term costs and plan their finances more effectively.

Part 2 – Currency Converter

This program simulates a simple currency exchange tool. It asks the user to input:
- The amount they want to convert
- The original currency
- The target currency

Using a manually entered exchange rate (for this assignment), it outputs the converted value. This helps demonstrate how real world currency apps function and showcases the role of exchange rates in financial decision making.
